# cimgui_nodes
 c-api wrapper for [ImGuiNodes](https://github.com/anthonyhan/ImguiNodes) which is a node editor for [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)

 You can use it together with [cimgui](https://github.com/cimgui/cimgui)


ImGuiNodes is a submodule of this repo. To do generation again in case ImGuiNodes is changed, you should update ImGuiNodes, make sure that cimgui repository is a sibling folder to this repository folder and execute generator/generator.bat(.sh)

The generator script is based on [cimgui](https://github.com/cimgui/cimgui) and its related projects. [Learn more](https://github.com/cimgui/cimgui)
